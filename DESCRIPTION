Description: Estimates expected cancer cases over time for a study cohort using
    age-band incidence and all-cause mortality rates. The cohort, supplied in
    5-year age bands, is internally expanded to single-year ages and propagated
    forward year-by-year: new cases are generated from age-specific incidence,
    deaths are applied from age-specific mortality, and survivors age by +1.
    Open-ended rate bands such as "85+" are supported (extended up to a user-
    specified 'age_max', typically 100). Outputs include a markdown-ready
    summary table and a year-by-year projection table (alive at start,
    new cases, deaths, aged-out, alive at end, cumulative cases).
